# Weather-Prediction
This repo is a personal project that I have been working on, that predicts the weather based on simplistic weather models using differential equations coupled with machine learning. I plan to have a live forcast of at least 3 days, and have my projections and the NOAA's projections for comparison, as well as an archive for historical predictions.
